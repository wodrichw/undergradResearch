   {}In computed tomography (CT) we recover a function $f$ from its x-ray data.  We model our x-ray data as line integrals of $f$ and then filter and backproject our data to recover $f$.  We present a study of artifacts that appear in a 3D reconstruction formula for CT \cite{kat} by studying the 2D case.

	We following the work of \cite{FHS}.  We have a rotating detector and x-ray source traveling around an object $f(x)$.  Here we assume a source curve $y(s) = (R \cos(s), R \sin(s))$ with radius $R$.  We have detector coordinates $e_u(s)$ and $e_v(s)$.  The vector $\Theta(s, x)$ points from $y(s)$ in the direction of $x$.  The angle between $e_u(s)$ and $\Theta(s, x)$ is $\alpha^*$.  The point $x$ has detector coordinate $\alpha^*$ and the x-ray data for $x$ is $g(s, \alpha^*)$.
	\begin{center}
		\input{images/fanbeam_geometry}
	\end{center}
	We suppose that our x-ray data is given to us by\begin{equation}
	g(s, \alpha^*) = \int_0^{\infty}f(y(s) + t \Theta(s, x)) \; dt.
	\end{equation}
	Our formula for $f$ is a 2D analog of Katsevich's 3D formula,
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	f(x) & = \frac 1 {2 \pi^2} \int_{I_{PI}(x)} \frac 1 {|x - y(s)|} \\ & \quad \int_0^{2 \pi} 
		\Big ( \frac {\partial g} {\partial s} + \frac {\partial g} {\partial \alpha} \Big )
		\frac 1 {\sin(\alpha^{\star} - \alpha)} \; d\alpha \; ds

	\begin{definition}
	A PI-line is any line segment passing through $x$ that intersects the source curve at $y(s_b)$ and $y(s_t)$ such that $s_t - s_b \le 2 \pi$. 
	\end{definition}That is to say that $s_b$ and $s_t$ are separated by no more than one turn.  We call $I_{PI} (x) = [s_b, s_t]$ the Parametric Interval or the PI-interval of $x$.  In the 3D case with a helical source curve every point within the helix belongs to a unique PI-line.  This is not the case for a circle as there exists infinitely many such lines that intersect the scanning circle and contain $x$.

	For the 2D case we consider a few special families of PI-lines.  The first correspond to the PI-intervals from the Helix, modulo $2\pi$, for the points that lie in the plane $z = 0$.  \begin{multicols}{2}
	The second type of PI-lines considered are called orthogonal-long PI-lines.  We take a line through $x$ with slope perpendicular to the polar angle of $x$.

	The tilted-long PI-line of a point $x$ corresponds to a orthogonal PI-line for the point $x'$ where $x' = A x$ and $A$ is given by the matrix
	\begin{equation}
		A = \sin(\psi) \left [ 
		\begin{array}{cc} 
		\sin(\psi) & -\cos(\psi) \\  
		\cos(\psi) & \sin(\psi)
		\end{array}

	\begin{definition}
		We call $RBP(s) = \{x : s \in I_{PI}(x) \}$ the region of back projection associated with position $y(s)$. 
	\end{definition}
The shape of the region of back projection in the 2D plane is directly related to the behavior of the comet tail artifact found in the 2D Katsevich algorithm.  We will now describe the region of back projection for orthogonal and tilted PI-lines.
Let $B$ be the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
\begin{theorem}
Suppose $R = 1$ and let $s \in [0, 2 \pi)$, then for the PI-lines of the orthogonal-long type we have $RBP(s) = B \cap D(s)$ where $D(s) = \{x : \|x - c \|_{2} \ge 1 / 2\}$ and $c = (\cos(s) / 2, \sin(s) / 2)$.
\end{theorem}
The $RBP(s)$ for the tilted-long PI-lines follows immediately.
\begin{corollary}
Suppose $R = 1$ and consider $B$ with the PI-lines of the tilted-long type.  Let $s \in [0, 2 \pi)$, then $s \in I_{PI}(x)$, for all $x \in B \cap D(s)$ where $D(s) = \{x : \|x - A^{-1}c \|_{2} \ge \frac 1 {2 \sin(\psi)} \}$ and $c = (\cos(s) / 2, \sin(s) / 2)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}(Outline)
This follows from Theorem 1 and the fact that
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\frac 1 4 & \le & \langle Ax - c, Ax - c \rangle \\
	& = & \langle Ax - A A^{-1}c, Ax - c \rangle \\
	& = & \langle x - A^{-1}c, A^* Ax - A^* c \rangle \\
	& = & \langle x - A^{-1}c, \sin^{2}(\psi) x - \sin^{2}(\psi)A^{-1} c \rangle \\
	& = & \sin^2 (\psi) \langle x - A^{-1}c, x - A^{-1}c \rangle.
\end{eqnarray*}
Hence $\| Ax - c \|_{2} \ge \frac 1 2$ if and only if $\| x - A^{-1}c \|_{2} \ge \frac 1 {2 \sin (\psi)}$.
\end{proof}

We can now identify where along the boundary of $RBP(s)$ a point $x$ will backproject to.  This corresponds to the end points of the outer integral in equation 1.

\begin{theorem}
\label{artifact_shape}
Let $f(x)$ be a delta function located at $(x_0, y_0) \in B$.  Let $\gamma(s)$ be the point on the boundary of $RBP(s)$ connecting $(x_0, y_0)$ to $y(s)$.  Then for the PI-lines of the orthogonal-long type we have $\gamma(s) = \frac d 2 (\cos(s + k), \sin(s + k)) + (\frac {x_0} 2, \frac {y_0}  2)$, for $d = \sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2}$, $k$ is a constant.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}(Outline)
We will use geometric argument that follows from the following diagram.
	\begin{center}
		\input{images/artifact_circle_argument}
	\end{center}
Let $A = (x_0, y_0), B = (\frac {x_0} {2}, \frac {y_0} {2}), C = (0, 0)$, and $F = y(s)$.  Let $B$ be the midpoint between $A$ and $C$ and let $D$ be the midpoint between $C$ and $E$.  Let $E = \gamma(s)$.  We will show the distance from $E$ to $B$ is fixed for all source positions.

The line segment $CE$ is perpendicular to line segment $AF$ since $E$ lies on a circle in the middle of $C$ and $F$.  Therefore triangle $ACE$ is similar to triangle $BCD$.  Furthermore triangle $BCD$ is congruent to triangle $BED$.  In particular we have that line segments $BA$, $BC$ and $BE$ have the same length.  Since $BC$ has fixed length we can conclude that the path of $\gamma(s)$ is a circle centered at $B$.
\end{proof}

It is difficult to analytically describe the region of back projection for the helical PI-lines.  The study of the orthogonal-long PI-lines has validated that the source of the comet tail artifact is the endpoints of integration in equation 1, $I_{PI}(x)$.

    We have shown that the selection of PI-lines will effect the shape of the RBP(s).  Furthermore we have created a method to determine where along the boundary of RBP(s) x-ray data from a point source will backproject to.  The curve $\gamma(s)$ in Theorem 2 corresponds to the location of the comet tail artifact associated with orthogonal-long pi-lines.
